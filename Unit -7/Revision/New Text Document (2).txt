 As you know my name is Ritesh Jha, and here I'm going to present one of my projects.
 So, first I would like to tell you about the project, so, it's a clone of an Ecommerce Website
 Overstock.com. And it's a collaborative project created by me and my 5 other teammates.
 We have used HTML, CSS, and Javascript. And deploy it on the Netlify link which I showing you here.

Now,let's come on this wesite. So, this is my landing page where and in footer part we have given search option, 
navbar ,login and signup , cart where people can choose items accordint to different catergories, this feature for make our website user friendly,
if you need any items of furniture then you simply needs to click on furniture option
 
When we come downside then here is lots of glimses of images which gives you about idea 
what the items present in our site.


And in footer part you have mentions contact, details and many more thins, and these a
are hard coded , and we didn't give any functionality due to lack of time,

Now come on product page and product detail pages which is created by me, 
 So, on product page you see different items, and when you click on any of this items 
then new pages appear with product detail. In this pages we miss the filter part 
becuase one of our teams mates didn't join us during projects and we have to complete
this in four days. I will complete this part. But we have given fileter part with price
rating here. Where you can filter product in three way.
