 Race condition in Java is a type of concurrency bug or
 issue that is introduced in our program because of 
 parallel execution of our program by multiple threads
 at the same time.
 
  In layman terms, a race condition can be defined as,
  a condition in which two or more threads compete together
  to get certain shared resources.
  For example, if thread A is reading data from the linked
  list and another thread B is trying to delete the same data.
  This process leads to a race condition that may result in
  run time error.
