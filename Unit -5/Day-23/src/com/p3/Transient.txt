 3. Explain Transient KeyWord.
 
 Ans : At the time of serialization, if we don’t want to save value of a particular 
 variable in a file,then we use transient keyword. When JVM comes across transient 
 keyword, it ignores original value of the variable and save default value of that variable data type.
 
  Another use of transient keyword is not to serialize the variable whose value can be calculated/derived 
  using other serialized objects or system such as age of a person, current date, etc.
