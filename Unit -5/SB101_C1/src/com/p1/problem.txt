  1 . Explain about wait() and notify() method.
    
 Ans :    we can call wait(), notify(),notifyAll() only in the synchronized block or synchronized 
       methods.otherwise we will get a runtime exception.

 To call wait() or notify() method on any object we must have that particular object lock otherwise
 we will get a runtime exception called IllegalMonitorStateException.


  wait() method is primarily used for the inter-thread communication.
  As wait() method is used to pause the current thread so its counter method is also provided in object 
  class to resume the thread which is notify() and notifyAll().
   
  The wait() method causes the current thread to wait until another thread invokes the notify() or notifyAll() methods for that object. The notify() method
   wakes up a single thread that is waiting on that object’s monitor. The notifyAll() method wakes up all threads that are waiting on that object’s monitor. 
   A thread waits on an object’s monitor by calling one of the wait() method. These methods can throw IllegalMonitorStateException if the current thread is
    not the owner of the object’s monitor.
