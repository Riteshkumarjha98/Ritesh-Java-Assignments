An interface in Java is defined as an abstract type that specifies class behavior. An interface is a kind of a 
protocol that sets up rules regarding how a particular class should behave. An interface in Java can contain 
abstract methods and static constants. By default, all the methods in the interface are public and abstract.

A simple example of an interface in Java is given below.

interface shape{
	public static final String color = “Red”;
	public void calculateArea();
}
The above example defines an interface ‘shape’ which has a static variable and an abstract method ‘calculateArea ()’.
