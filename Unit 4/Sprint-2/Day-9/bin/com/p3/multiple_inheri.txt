      Q3) Why is multiple inheritance not supported in Java at class level ?


  Ans:-    Consider a case where class B extends class A and Class C and both class A and C have the same method display().

     Now java compiler cannot decide, which display method it should inherit. To prevent such situation, multiple
    
     inheritances is not allowed in java.
     
     
     Example:-     public class extends Animal, Mammal{}
