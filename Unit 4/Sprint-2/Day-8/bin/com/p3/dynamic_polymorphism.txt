     Ans:- The word polymorphism is a combination of two words i.e. ploy and morphs.
        The word poly means many and morphs means different forms. 
        In short, a mechanism by which we can perform a single action in different ways.
    
      
        Dynamic polymorphism is a process or mechanism in which a call to an overridden method
        is to resolve at runtime rather than compile-time. It is also known as runtime polymorphism
         or dynamic method dispatch. We can achieve dynamic polymorphism by using the method overriding.

        In this process, an overridden method is called through a reference variable of a superclass. 
        The determination of the method to be called  is based on the object being referred to by the reference variable.
