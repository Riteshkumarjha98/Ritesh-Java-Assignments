  
  Explain Finally and Final Keyword with an Example?

 Ans :-  The finally keyword is used to create a block of code that follows a try block.
        A finally block of code always executes, whether or not an exception has occurred.
        Using a finally block allows you to run any cleanup-type statements that you just
         wish to execute, despite what happens within the protected code.
  
  
       The final keyword can be used with class method and variable. A final class 
      cannot be inherited, a final method cannot be overridden and a final variable cannot
      be reassigned.
